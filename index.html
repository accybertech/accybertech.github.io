Hello! My name is Antonino and Iâ€™ve been passionate about technology since I was a child. Over the years, Iâ€™ve cultivated this passion and turned it into a profession: today I work in IT, cybersecurity, software development, and IT consulting.

I enjoy exploring new technologies, building customized solutions, and helping businesses and individuals improve their digital systems. I specialize in web development, server management, networking, and security systems, always with a focus on usability and efficiency.

In my free time, I keep studying and staying up to date, because in this field, standing still means falling behind. When Iâ€™m not at the computer, I like reading, taking long walks, and experimenting with new open-source projects.

This website showcases some of my projects, thoughts, and useful tools. If you'd like to collaborate, have an idea to develop, or simply want to chat, feel free to contact me. Iâ€™d be happy to meet you!
